# About

**[C.R.E.A.M](https://github.com/couger-inc/cream)** stands for **Confidential Reliable Ethereum Anonymous Mixer**. It is a protocol being developed as part of a pilot program to develop a more robust, accessible, secure, anonymous and verifiable voting technology for elections and other situations that require voting.

The protocol consists of a smart contract and a zero-knowledge component. The C.R.E.A.M smart contract handles the validation of voting status, permissions and proofs on-chain. The zero-knowledge component works off-chain, allowing the user to generate proofs, and if these proofs are valid, the smart contract can update the state.

## System design
C.R.E.A.M aims to be simple in design, with the basic functions being "deposit" which means reception of the token used in the vote, and "drawer" which means casting the vote. 

To ensure the secrecy of the vote, the voter generates a random value on their device when they make a deposit. Anyone who knows this random value can withdraw it, making the source of the token (i.e. the address where the deposit was made) secret.

### Basic features

Here's what you'll need to do to set it up in a nutshell:

1. Set the required deposit amount.
2. Set the recipients' (candidates') ethereum addresses.

All other election-specific parameters are automatically passed to the constructor at contract deployment time. You can check out the configuration in the source code [here](https://github.com/couger-inc/cream/blob/master/config/test.yml).
